<ul><li><a href="join.html">Join</a></li></ul><p>Rlogin is a remote 
shell 
client 
(like ssh) designed 
to be fast 
and 
small. It is not encryped, which may have some small drawbacks in 
high-security enviroments, but that allows it to use a very high speed. 
Both the server (daemon) and client do not use very much memory. I am 
looking for more developers so if you are interested in joining, just 
sign up!</p>
